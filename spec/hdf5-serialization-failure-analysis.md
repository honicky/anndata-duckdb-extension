# HDF5 Serialization Approach - Failure Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes why the mutex-based serialization approach for HDF5 concurrent access failed and why it's fundamentally incompatible with DuckDB's execution model.

## What We Tried

### Approach 1: Simple Mutex
```cpp
class H5Reader {
private:
    static std::mutex hdf5_mutex;
    
    // In every HDF5 operation:
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(hdf5_mutex);
    // ... HDF5 operations ...
```

**Result**: Immediate deadlocks when UNION queries tried to access multiple files.

### Approach 2: Reader Count with Condition Variable
```cpp
static std::mutex access_mutex;
static std::condition_variable access_cv;
static int active_readers = 0;
static constexpr int MAX_CONCURRENT_READERS = 1;

// Wait for exclusive access
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(access_mutex);
access_cv.wait(lock, [] { 
    return active_readers < MAX_CONCURRENT_READERS; 
});
active_readers++;
```

**Result**: Hangs indefinitely - threads waiting to release never get scheduled.

## Why It Failed

### 1. DuckDB's Parallel Execution Model

DuckDB executes UNION branches in parallel:
```sql
SELECT * FROM anndata_scan_x('file1.h5ad')
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM anndata_scan_x('file2.h5ad')
```

- Thread 1 starts scanning file1.h5ad, acquires exclusive HDF5 access
- Thread 2 tries to scan file2.h5ad, blocks waiting for HDF5 access
- Thread 1 yields to DuckDB scheduler while holding the lock
- Thread 2 is scheduled but can't proceed (waiting for lock)
- Deadlock: Thread 1 won't be rescheduled until Thread 2 makes progress

### 2. Table Function Execution Pattern

DuckDB table functions use a pull-based model:
1. `Init()` - Initialize scan state
2. `Function()` - Called repeatedly to get chunks
3. Multiple threads can call `Function()` concurrently for different scans

With serialization:
- Thread A calls `Function()`, acquires lock, reads chunk, releases lock
- Thread B waits for lock during Thread A's operation
- If Thread A yields while holding lock → deadlock
- If we release lock between chunks → corrupted HDF5 state

### 3. HDF5 Global State

HDF5 maintains global state that's not thread-safe:
- Error stacks
- Property lists
- ID management tables
- Cached metadata

Even with fine-grained locking:
```cpp
mutex.lock();
H5Dopen(...);  // Modifies global ID table
mutex.unlock();
// Another thread modifies global state here
mutex.lock();
H5Dread(...);  // May use corrupted global state
mutex.unlock();
```

## Why Fine-Grained Locking Doesn't Work

### Attempt: Lock Only During HDF5 Calls
```cpp
void ReadXMatrix(...) {
    // No lock here
    prepare_buffers();
    
    hdf5_mutex.lock();
    H5Dread(...);  // Only lock for actual HDF5 call
    hdf5_mutex.unlock();
    
    // No lock here
    process_data();
}
```

**Problems**:
1. HDF5 operations are not atomic - `H5Dread` may internally call multiple functions that expect consistent global state
2. Handle management is stateful - opening a dataset modifies global tables that must remain consistent
3. Error handling uses global error stacks that can be corrupted by concurrent access

### Attempt: Connection Pool
```cpp
class H5ConnectionPool {
    std::queue<H5Reader*> available;
    std::mutex pool_mutex;
    
    H5Reader* acquire() {
        std::lock_guard lock(pool_mutex);
        if (available.empty()) {
            wait_or_create_new();
        }
        // ...
    }
};
```

**Problems**:
1. HDF5 library has single global context - multiple H5File objects share state
2. Can't have truly independent connections to same library instance
3. Would need separate HDF5 library instances (not possible in single process)

## Why Thread-Safe HDF5 Doesn't Help with C++ API

The HDF5 C++ API is fundamentally incompatible with thread-safe builds:

1. **C++ API uses exceptions**: Thread-safe HDF5 disables error stacks, breaking C++ exception handling
2. **RAII doesn't work**: C++ destructors can't safely call HDF5 functions in thread-safe mode
3. **Static initialization**: C++ API uses static objects that aren't thread-safe

From HDF5 documentation:
> "The thread-safe library does not support the C++ API. The C++ API relies on the error stack and error handling mechanisms that are disabled in thread-safe mode."

## DuckDB-Level Solutions (Why They Don't Work)

### Setting max_threads=1
```sql
SET max_threads=1;
```
- Works but kills performance for entire query
- Can't dynamically detect when multiple H5 files are used
- No way to set per-table-function

### Custom Execution Constraints
Would need DuckDB core changes:
```cpp
// Hypothetical API (doesn't exist)
table_function.execution_mode = ExecutionMode::SEQUENTIAL;
```
- Requires modifying DuckDB itself
- Would still serialize all H5 operations, not just concurrent ones

## Conclusion

The serialization approach is fundamentally incompatible with DuckDB's parallel execution model because:

1. **Blocking waits cause deadlocks**: DuckDB's scheduler doesn't know about our locks
2. **Releasing locks between operations corrupts state**: HDF5 isn't designed for interleaved access
3. **Fine-grained locking is unsafe**: HDF5's global state requires coarse-grained synchronization
4. **C++ API can't be made thread-safe**: Fundamental design incompatibility

The only viable solution is migrating to the HDF5 C API with thread-safe build, which:
- Provides proper internal synchronization
- Doesn't rely on exception handling
- Supports concurrent access from multiple threads
- Has been designed for multi-threaded environments

Even with the thread-safe C API, HDF5 internally serializes operations, but it does so safely without causing deadlocks or corruption.
